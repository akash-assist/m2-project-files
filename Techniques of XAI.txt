LIME, SHAP, Integrated Gradients, PDP, ELI5, Anchor Explanations, and Counterfactual Explanations
As AI models become increasingly complex, understanding how they make decisions is crucial. This is especially true in fields like healthcare, finance, and law, where transparency and accountability are paramount. Explainable AI (XAI) helps by making AI models more interpretable. This blog will introduce seven tools and techniques for model interpretability, providing software developers with practical ways to demystify AI.








1. LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)
What Is LIME?
LIME is a popular tool for interpreting complex models. It works by approximating the model locally with an interpretable model, such as a linear regression or decision tree.

How It Works
Local perturbation: LIME slightly alters your input data around the prediction you want to explain.
Interpretable model fitting: It then builds a simpler model that mimics how the complex model behaved for that specific input.
Explanation generation: The simple model provides insights into which features influenced the complex model's prediction. 
Use Case
LIME is particularly useful when you need to explain individual predictions. Say you have a credit scoring model. LIME can explain why a particular loan application was rejected, highlighting key factors that influenced the decision.

import lime
import lime.lime_tabular 
explainer = lime.lime_tabular.LimeTabularExplainer(training_data, mode='classification')
exp = explainer.explain_instance(data_row, model.predict_proba)
exp.show_in_notebook()








2. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
What Is SHAP?
Ever wondered how much credit each player deserves in a team effort? SHAP tackles feature importance similarly. It assigns a value to each feature, indicating how much it contributed (positively or negatively) to a specific prediction. SHAP values offer a unified measure of feature importance, providing consistent and interpretable explanations.

How It Works
Shapley values: Derived from cooperative game theory, Shapley values attribute the contribution of each feature to the model’s prediction.
Additivity: SHAP values are additive, meaning the sum of the feature contributions equals the model output.
Use Case
SHAP is ideal for understanding feature importance, especially in models where features interact significantly. It helps identify which features have the most significant influence on the model's output.

import shap
explainer = shap.Explainer(model)
shap_values = explainer(X)
shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X)








3. Integrated Gradients
What Are Integrated Gradients?
Integrated Gradients is a technique for attributing the prediction of a neural network to its input features. Imagine coloring a path through a maze to visualize the effort required to reach the exit. Integrated Gradients work similarly for complex models, particularly neural networks used for image or text data. It visualizes how each feature contributes to a prediction by highlighting the path an input takes through the model. Areas with stronger positive or negative gradients indicate features that heavily influenced the outcome.

How It Works
Baseline comparison: It compares the model's predictions with a baseline (e.g., all-zero input).
Integral calculation: It calculates the integral of the gradients along the path the input takes through the neural network, from the baseline to the actual input. This provides insights into feature contributions.
Use Case
Integrated Gradients are effective for interpreting image and text-based neural networks. Steeper gradients in certain regions of an image, for example, can indicate that those areas significantly influenced the model's prediction. While implementing Integrated Gradients from scratch can be complex, libraries like TensorFlow can simplify the process.

import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np 
def integrated_gradients(model, x, baseline=None, steps=50):
    if baseline is None:
        baseline = np.zeros_like(x)
    baseline = tf.convert_to_tensor(baseline)
    x = tf.convert_to_tensor(x)
    interpolated = [baseline + (float(i) / steps) * (x - baseline) for i in range(steps + 1)]
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        tape.watch(interpolated)
        preds = model(interpolated)
    grads = tape.gradient(preds, interpolated)
    avg_grads = np.average(grads[:-1], axis=0)
    integrated_grads = (x - baseline) * avg_grads
    return integrated_grads
​










4. Partial Dependence Plots (PDP)
What Are PDPs?
PDPs show the relationship between a feature and the predicted outcome of a model.

How It Works
Marginal effect: PDPs depict the average effect of a feature on the model's predictions by averaging out the effects of other features.
Visualization: They provide a clear visual representation of how changing a single feature value impacts the model's average prediction.
Use Case
PDPs are useful for understanding the impact of specific features in regression and classification models.

from sklearn.inspection import plot_partial_dependence
plot_partial_dependence(model, X, [0, 1, 2])  # Features indices to plot








5. ELI5 (Explain Like I'm Five)
What Is ELI5?
ELI5 provides simple and easy-to-understand explanations for machine learning models, making it accessible for non-experts.

How It Works
Feature weights: It visualizes feature weights for linear models and feature importances for tree-based models.
Text explanations: For text data, ELI5 highlights important words or phrases that significantly influence the model's output.
Use Case
ELI5 is a great tool for generating straightforward explanations for logistic regression and tree-based models, making them accessible to a wider audience.

import eli5
from eli5.sklearn import PermutationImportance
perm = PermutationImportance(model, random_state=1).fit(X, y)
eli5.show_weights(perm, feature_names = X.columns.tolist())















6. Anchor Explanations
What Are Anchor Explanations?
Anchor explanations are a form of local explanation that provide high-precision if-then rules (anchors) that "anchor" the decision.

How It Works
Precision rules: It identifies a subset of features that guarantees the same prediction with high confidence. These features form the "anchor" of the explanation.
Interactive exploration: Users can interactively explore the conditions leading to a prediction, fostering deeper understanding.
Use Case
Anchor explanations are useful for models where clear, rule-based explanations are needed, such as regulatory environments.


from anchor import anchor_tabular
explainer = anchor_tabular.AnchorTabularExplainer(class_names, feature_names, data)
exp = explainer.explain_instance(data_row, model.predict, threshold=0.95)
exp.show_in_notebook()












7. Counterfactual Explanations
What Are Counterfactual Explanations?
Counterfactual explanations describe how to change the input to achieve a desired prediction.

How It Works
Alternative scenarios: It identifies minimal changes to the input that would change the prediction to a specified outcome.
Actionable insights: Provides actionable insights for individuals affected by model decisions.
Use Case
Counterfactual explanations are beneficial in scenarios like loan applications, where applicants need to understand what changes can improve their chances of approval.

from alibi.explainers import Counterfactual
explainer = Counterfactual(model, shape=(1, 28, 28, 1), distance_fn='l2', target_proba=1.0, lam_init=1e-1, max_iter=1000)
explanation = explainer.explain(X)
explanation.plot() 











Beyond the Tools: Responsible AI Development
While these XAI tools are powerful, remember that XAI is more than just a technical exercise. When developing AI models, consider fairness, accountability, and transparency throughout the entire process. Here are some additional tips:

Start with clean, unbiased data: Garbage in, garbage out. Ensure your training data is representative and free from biases that can lead to unfair model behavior.
Document your model development process: Keep a clear record of the choices you make during model development, data selection, and feature engineering. This helps in understanding potential biases and facilitates future improvements.
Continuously monitor and evaluate your models: Model performance can degrade over time. Regularly monitor your models for fairness, bias drift, and accuracy to ensure they continue to make responsible decisions.
By embracing XAI techniques and fostering responsible development practices, you, as a developer, can play a crucial role in building trustworthy and ethical AI models.
